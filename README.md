# Personality-Test

This is a project made for my Intro to Psychology class. It is a website that first prompts users with 25 questions that each have slider, and users drag the slider to show the level to which they agree with the prompt. After they submit, it shows them a page with 5 personality traits, and estimates the amount of each trait the user has based on their responses. It will show either a trait or its antonym (i.e. neuroticism or balance) depending on which the user aligned more with, so there will never be one with less than 50% agreeance.

Currently it doesn't work, but a goal before this project is due is to connect to the google api and store responses to the test in a google sheet, so that responses can be compared to each other, perhaps giving users a percentile for their results.

This project was a collaboration with Reed.

The site is hosted through netlify.com, and all coding work was done in notepad++.
